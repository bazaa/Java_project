Java Variables
Variables in Java are containers that store data values. Here's an overview of the key concepts:
Variable Declaration and Initialization
javaCopy// Declaration
int age;

// Declaration with initialization
int score = 95;

// Multiple variables of the same type
int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
Data Types in Java
Java has several primitive data types:

Integer types:

byte: 8-bit (-128 to 127)
short: 16-bit (-32,768 to 32,767)
int: 32-bit (most common integer type)
long: 64-bit (add 'L' suffix for literals, e.g., long value = 100000000L;)


Floating-point types:

float: 32-bit (add 'F' suffix, e.g., float price = 19.99F;)
double: 64-bit (default for decimal values)


Character type:

char: Stores a single character using single quotes (e.g., char grade = 'A';)


Boolean type:

boolean: Stores true/false values


Reference types:

Objects, arrays, String, etc.



Variable Naming Rules

Can contain letters, digits, underscore (_), and dollar sign ($)
Must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
Cannot use reserved keywords
Case-sensitive
Should use camelCase by convention (e.g., firstName)

Type Conversion
javaCopy// Implicit conversion (widening)
int myInt = 100;
long myLong = myInt; // Automatically converts int to long

// Explicit conversion (narrowing)
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting, results in 9
Constants
javaCopy// Using the final keyword creates a constant
final double PI = 3.14159;
Variable Scope

Local variables: Declared within methods, constructors, or blocks
Instance variables: Declared in a class but outside methods
Static variables: Declared with the static keyword, shared across all instances
